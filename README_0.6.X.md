# Kuuube's **CHATTER EXTERMINATOR** Plugin for [OpenTabletDriver](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver)

Extremely simple to use with perfect low latency **CHATTER EXTERMINATION**

## Quick Start Guide:
- Enable either the raw version or the smooth version.
- Input a number 1-20 (and 1000hz when using the smooth version).
- Apply the settings.

### Tips:
- Recommended settings for the raw version: 2-3 for drag and 5-6 for hover.
- Recommended settings for the smooth version: 6-7 for drag and 15-16 for hover.

### Notes:
- The raw version has no added latency.
- The smooth version has a slight bit of latency added to make it smoother. Using the smooth version instead of the raw version should help if you have issues with choppy movement on the raw version.
