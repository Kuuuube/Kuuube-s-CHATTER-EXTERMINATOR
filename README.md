Extremely simple to use with perfect low latency **CHATTER EXTERMINATION**.

## Quick Start Guide:
- Enable either the filter version or the interpolator version.
- Input a number 1-20 (and 1000hz when using the interpolator version).
- Apply the settings.

### Tips:
- Recommended settings for the filter version: 2-3 for drag and 5-6 for hover.
- Recommended settings for the interpolator version: 6-7 for drag and 15-16 for hover.

### Notes:
- The filter version has no added latency.
- The interpolator version has a slight bit of latency added to make it smoother. Using the interpolator version instead of the filter version should help if you have issues with choppy movement on the filter version.
