# Kuuube's **CHATTER EXTERMINATOR**

Extremely simple to use with perfect low latency **CHATTER EXTERMINATION**

Simply enable the filter or interpolator and input a number 1-10 (and 1000 for hertz if using the interpolator) then apply the settings.

Recommended settings: 2-3 for drag and 5 for hover.

The filter version is slightly lower latency (0ms vs 1ms) compared to the interpolator version. However, the interpolator will remove any choppiness caused by moving at slow speeds.
